# Machine Learning Workshop

Welcome to this repository where you will find the instructions for how to complete the extended lab exercises for this program.

The labs are not designed to be click through exercises where you simply follow the instructions, but rather, you will need to research and investigate how best to solve the various challenges described here.

The core of these exercises is to complete the following:

1. Build a Machine Learning Deployment Pipeline for an ML model that uses the prebuilt SageMaker Algorithm xgboost.

2. Build a Machine Learning Deployment Pipeline for an ML model that uses a custom Docker image for a custom algorithm.

3. Deploy an application that consists of a number of Lambda functions that uses some of the AWS high level AWS ML services.


For each of these exercises, all the code you should need for your pipelines has been provided for you in the form of a Git Repository. Your task in a nutshell, is to get it running in your own AWS account.

Each of the exercises is not meant to be the definitive way that you must deploy models, but rather, to illustrate some of the best practices, services from AWS, and techniques that you can apply when deploying your own models in a production environment.
